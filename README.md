Make Glagoljica Great Again is a simple FF extension that will convert Latin script to Glagolitic.

This FF extension is currently released for testing purposes and fun. To try it out, downlad the XPI file from the /build directory. Then go to Firefox and open about:debugging. From there you can easily load the XPI file as a temporary extension.

We will be releasing a fully signed extension later on.

Have fun!
